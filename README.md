# Spotify Circles

As part of my Product School course, I worked on a project where I went through the experience of adding a new feature to an existing product Spotify called _Spotify Circles_.

_Spotify Circles_ aims to remove the hassle that users feel while using the platform to listen to music in a social context.

To learn more about the feature, you can read a sample [Press Release](PressRelease.md) covering the feature.

For a more detailed specification, you can refer to the [Product Requirements Document](PRD.md) created for the feature.

Please review the final [slide deck](SpotifyPS.pptx) to get an overview of the proposed feature.
